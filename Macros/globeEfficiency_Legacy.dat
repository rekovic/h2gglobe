# write eff val and its error in separate columns
# write them in the order defined by effTypes
# this is important as presel has different categories than the others
# i.e. :
# effTypes=presel,id,etc.
# cat0 preselEff preselEffErr idEff idEffErr etc.
# use effL1HLT to pass L1+HLT efficiency and error
# use effHighR9 to pass HighR9EB eff and error, HighR9EE eff and error
